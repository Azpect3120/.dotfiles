# Dotfile Config!

Neovim config can be found here in the `/nvim` directory.

NOTE: I have deleted my neovim-config repo and have added the config here in this repo!

## Refactor
The new branches are as follows:
- `master` - contains the old config
- `desktop` - contains the new config for manjaro/i3 desktop
- `laptop` - contains the new config for manjaro/i3 laptop
